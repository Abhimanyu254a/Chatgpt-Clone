# ChatGPT Clone

This project is a ChatGPT clone, designed to simulate conversational AI by utilizing Google Gemini LLM through an API key. The application mimics the functionality of ChatGPT, providing responsive and contextually aware conversations. It's built with a Flask backend, which integrates with the Google Gemini API for language model interactions, and a simple front-end created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a user-friendly chat experience.

## Project Logic

The core logic of this application centers around making API requests to Google Gemini LLM via Flask. When a user inputs a message, the frontend sends it to the Flask backend, which, in turn, relays the message to the Google Gemini API. The API responds with a generated reply based on the conversation context, which is then sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user in real-time.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript – for creating the user interface and managing interactions.
- **Backend**: Flask – to handle API requests and manage server-client communications.
- **Language Model**: Google Gemini LLM API – for generating responses based on user input.

## Features

- Real-time interaction with conversational AI
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- API integration for enhanced natural language processing capabilities

This ChatGPT clone provides a lightweight, responsive, and accessible conversational interface using the latest in LLM technology, allowing users to engage with AI in a familiar chat format.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a Google Gemini API key.
3. Run the Flask application.
4. Access the chat interface via your local server.
